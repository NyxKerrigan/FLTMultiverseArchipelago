This with formatting and better updated

This is the Doc to go along with the Manual for FTL:multiverse I have made
Mod list: 


FTL: multiverse
Super magic hat (this allows you to use the magic hat every time)
Boons, Hats and Prep Options
System uncapper (https://ftlmultiverse.boards.net/thread/61/mv-5-breaking-balance-collection)
Cody's Collection - Internalize External Augments (this allows for all of the random AUGs you get to be installed) (https://ftlmultiverse.boards.net/thread/140/)
TRC: 2.5 (not needed but I like it)


This was designed with just the base 64 Regions and as such won’t include naturally any Extras from Lost Races, Outer Expansion, or Deep Ones ect. but those ships should still be fine to use (just avoid going to those areas as there won’t be any checks there)

Most things need to be done via the console
You can either add systems via console or be bought
All Unique Sectors *Logicly* Require a non Unique sector to get to [Will Probably end up Scraping this idea]
This was designed to be played with any ship and to go for True or HER endings
Weapons, Shields, Engines, and Drones are not Items so feel free to spend scrap on them
Withers is actual the AUG ANCIENT_ACTIVATOR (needed for true ending)
Each level of CURAs tasks are unlock separately
HER realm and Ancient homeworld do not have sector items as I felt like you can’t not go to them after their respective prezone
Crew upgrades do count Crew you find but don’t include Drones or Starting Crew (Node 17 can get you a crewmate with all skills at lvl 2 if needed)
If the Ship you are using has levels higher than standard (e.g. level 4 Cloning bay) you may take that upgrade after you hit the max standard level
The EVENT FREE_ITEMS is meant for your current run
IF you get to node 17 without having it please restart you run
The get past the “Guard” check is valid for anyway you get past the guard same is true for the store check even if you blow it up (looking at you Coalition shops)
All Augments have what you need to type into the client you need to get them
All internal upgrades have there Aug Counterpart* (Aether tech Augments don’t)
I will now go through the Progressive AUGs
	Progressive AUG SLUG_GEL 
	SLUG_GEL
	HEKTAR_GEL
	PLEASURE_GEL
Progressive AUG CREW_STIMS
	CREW_STIMS
	SUPER_CREW_STIMS
	SUZERAIN_CREW_STIMS
	LOCKED_ELITE_STIMS (note you might not want to take this if not using mantis)
Progressive AUG STORE_BEACON_SUPER (super OP)
	STORE_BEACON_SYLVAN 
 	GATLING_MAKER
	STORE_BEACON_SUPER
Progressive AUG ANCIENT_SHIELD
	ANCIENT_SHIELD
	ROYAL_SHIELD
Progressive AUG WEAPON_PREIGNITE
	WEAPON_PREIGNITE
	ANCIENT_PREIGNITE
Progressive AUG SYLVAN_SHIELD
	SYLVAN_SHIELD
	SYLVAN_SHIELD_CONTIUNITY



If you want to use a New save I recommend Setting the following Meta variables
	METAVAR prof_finalsector: 2
	METAVAR prof_renegades_killed: 5
	METAVAR prof_opened_nexus: 1 (this make Obyn or Anurak not needed for Nexus)
	METAVAR chaos_mode_unlock: 1 (this is so you can grab the gnome ones CHOAS MODE item is grabbed)
	METAVAR magical_hat: 1 (allows you to grab the hat)
	METAVAR prof_judges_met: 1
After loading into the game for the first time you can set these and then restart your run to have all of them activate


Most sectors aren't done and only have a Guard store and leave check
Early Sector’s have a Defeat enemies counter to hopefully front end most of the checks
Things to do 
Add Balance, Weapons, Shield, Engines, and Drones to findable upgrades
Add Default encounters to every zone
Make use of Hooks so that how many enemies you need to kill can be set
Make use of Hooks so you can set which goal you want to use
Add More Augments
Add Transports checks
Add CURA tasks as locations and CURA items 
Add every Renegade with MVBOSS_SPAWNER add a prerequisite
Add Renegade weapons to item pool
Add both unique characters items and the questline to get them
Judge Boons 
Make a mod to make this automatic (this is a pipe dream as I have no idea how to mod FTL)
What Sector is Irwin again? (also update wiki with correct one cause it says Broodworld Stronghold which isn’t a Sector)
Longest check name “Grand Priest of the Eternal Ember and Keeper of the Holy Texts, Lord Vortigon Obadann XIV [Crystalline Origins Sector]”
A55 is in the wrong sector
EVENT FREE_ITEMS*
Give Jerry a Gun
